1)
	Training RMSE:  2.87631708961
	Testing RMSE:  2.98110717687

2)
	The optimal lambda is 0.00751694681821. I add up all the RMSE of the same lambda for different folds. And the sum of the RMSE is the least when lambda is the above value.

	RMSE for test set is 2.35387628041

3)
	The optimal lambda is 0.0422351360321 using the same procesure as above.

	RMSE for test set is 2.3518483114

4)	Without cross-validation, the optimal lambda is 0.421875

	RMSE for test set is 2.35994328475
